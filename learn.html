                  <h2>rules</h2>
                  <p> there are no  official rules in rocket league like in soccer. but there are strategizes,
                     which help you win game like "left goes first" meaning any time there is a kickoff. the person left most goes for the ball while the
                     other stay game or move up a little to assit the left most player.(kickoff is a kick that puts the ball into play in a football or soccer game). 
                     this makes is so that not more than one is on the ball and making it so that if the ball gets the first player the second who stayed back can get it.

               <h2> basic objective</h2>
               <P> On the right are the basics of how to control the car. the next thing to learn when starting out is hitting the ball and the ability to hit the ball into the goal.</p>
               <P> the best to learn how to the ball in order to go where you want it to, is to do the basic training that rocket league provides. it teaches the basics of control and aerialing and defending.
                  are the 3 biggest parts of rocket league. each one crucial in ranking up to the next rank. 
               </p>
               <p>I recommend watching Thanovics, the ultimate beginner guide.
                  his a grand champion level player which is one level under the best-rank supersonic. he goes over everything that is important when practicing basics.

                  </div>
                  <p> I practiced rocket league basics training for about 60 to 70 hours before moving on but would recommend at least 100 hours to truly understand the essence of saving shots, shooting, and aerialing in rocket league. </p>
                  <p>  it should take about 1-2 months to spend 100 hours on rocket league, after that, I recommend watching Waytons video on shooting called "how to shot effectively in rocket league". because when shooting you have to take into account your location, and speed,
                     while also constantly checking the ball's speed and location. It's one of the hardest to understand, and gets harder as you try to improve it. Wayton does an excellent job breaking it all down. I recommend practicing shooting for about 30-1h a day with the principal taught in this video.
                  </p>

                  </div>
                  <p> one thing you have to keep in mind, while is practicing you giving all your attention to what you're doing because it doesn't matter if you have spent 100 hours or 400 hours you can have the same amount of achievements.
                     if one is paying attention more than the other. congratulations you are now a platinum player, and it's time to 4x the time on you so far so that you may get to diamond. click improve to read about more complex mechanics.
