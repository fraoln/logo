                  <p> Platinum 1 to diamond 3 it involves improving your basic controls. before now you practiced how to flip and jump to get faster speed,
                     but there is a big problem with jumping while boosting to gain faster speed. which is if your directional travel is not the same as where your car is facing. 
                     either one of 2 things happens you lose control of your car or lose a lot of speed. which leads to you being down a goal or 2. 
                     the way to fix that is to practice how to powerslide properly, which makes it so that when master you never have to lose speed and lose control of your car when making saves.

                  <p>  The bronze to platinum and on, aerials go from a skill that's not needed to a skill that is crucials before platinum you went up to get the ball once or twice. 
                    But at Platinum that number doubles or triples in regular games. and you can't get to the ball in the air you will most likely lose. how then how do you improve this on so crucial skills?
                     will it takes tens of hours but you can do it. 
                  </p>
                  <p> How do you get started then, ill tell you, Wayton has this great video, on how to aerial. from the basics how much you need to tilt your car to how when you use your send jump. 
                     all so that you can to the and match your opponents. after 30 hours of practice.

                  <p>after spending time playing the game you will notice you're lacking something huge which makes it so you can't work together with your teammates. which then keep at lower ranks because the higher rank you go the better they are working together.
                     working together is not possible when you can't directly talk to your teammate, which is why rotations exist. rotations make at the high level make it so that could play professionally without even talking to your teammates. they are super 
                     power and the reason why is because they require you to play as a teammate and do things for the team and not just yourself.  which in turn makes teammate a lot easier to do. when you don't chase after every ball because you're looking at it.
                  </p>
                  <p> Now that I have explained why rotations are so important, listen to Virge whom explains how to improve your teamwork/rotations which in turn help you rank up.</p>
